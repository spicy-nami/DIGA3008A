                <div class="e-content">
                    <p>Hi, I'm Iman!ðŸ‘‹

                        I'm a digital artist with a heart full of passion for design, art, and making the world a more
                        accessible place. For me, creativity isn't just about aestheticsâ€”it's about connection. I
                        specialize in Interaction Design (IxD) and User Interface (UI) design, where I focus on crafting
                        experiences that are not only visually stunning but also intuitive, inclusive, and
                        human-centered.</p>

                   <p><strong>I believe great design should empower everyone, regardless of ability or background.</strong></p>


                    <p> When I'm not designing, you'll find me diving deep into the world of comic books as a
                        researcher. I'm fascinated by the storytelling, visual language, and the cultural impact of comics. Whether it's through my art, my
                        research, or my daily work, my mission is to create spacesâ€”both digital and physical where
                        everyone feels seen, heard, and valued.

                        Let's make the world a little more colorful, a little more thoughtful, and a whole lot more
                        accessible, one pixel at a time! ðŸ’»âœ¨</p>
